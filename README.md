## ü§åüèª Short Story

This project was created to fulfill the technical test for PT. AKP recruitment.
I have never created a monorepo project using javascript before. This is a challenge for me, where I have to learn about the recommended tech stack in the recruitment process.
The time I need to learn (from the initial setup) is 1 day. Then after that I learn by doing.
Then in 7 days I can complete the main task in this technical test. Currently there is still time until June 1, so I will try to complete the optional tasks.
